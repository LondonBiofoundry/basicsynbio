    "# json for BasicBuild objects\n",

    "## Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to aid developing the `json` representation of `BasicBuild` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements for json representation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Object easily converted into build instructions for liquid-handling robotics.\n",
    "2. *Object facilitates validation of constructs.*\n",
    "3. Capable of decoding object back into a BasicBuild object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Draft data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "build = {\n",
    "    \"unique_parts\": {\n",

    "        }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Decided not to put clips_data in an array given multiple of the same clip reaction can be required. However, only one of each basic assembly is constructed and therefore order could be important during construction and validation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## How build json object facilitates instructions for building assemblies?\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific build instructions would centre around setting up clip reactions and completing assemblies. Arguments for purification and transformation steps are easily inferred from arguments used to setup these two critical processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "To setup clip reactions:\n",
    "- `\"clips_data\"` contains information on what prefix, suffix and part to transfer including id and sequence. This information could be used to query databases describing collections of parts/linkers in lab freezers, enabling substrates to be parsed into liquid-handling robotic jobs.\n",
    "- Parts sequences in combination with concentration values can be used to ensure the correct volume of part is transfered during clip reaction setups.\n",
    "- To calculate the number of times a specific clip reaction must be repeated in a build, it provides the `\"basic_assemblies\"` array which lists which assemblies use this specific clip reaction. The number of times the i<sup>th</sup> clip reaction must be repeated is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = len(build.clips_data[i].basic_assemblies)/assemblies_per_clip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `assemblies_per_clip` will vary depending on the liquid-handling platform used e.g. Opentrons OT-2, Lacyte Echo etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete assemblies:\n",
    "- Each object in `build.basic_assemblies` contains the indexes of required clip reactions as an array (`clips_indexes`). These can be used to identify which specific clip reactions to transfer when assembling the construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to validate constructs from a build?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the basicsynbio package, export BasicAssembly objects within the `BasicBuild.basic_assemblies` attribute to a GenBank file using the `export_sequences_to_file` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import basicsynbio as bsb\n",
    "my_build = bsb.BasicBuild(*my_assemblies)\n",
    "bsb.export_sequences_to_file(my_build.basic_assemblies, handle=file_handle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The id attribute of a `build.basic_assemblies` element will match the [VERSION field](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sitemap/samplerecord.html#VersionB) of the associated genbank entry in the resulting file. *Furthermore, the order of basic assemblies in both should match making it easy to associate assemblies*. A  Basic Assembly construct has been successfully assembled if it's sequence matches that prediceted by the genbank file. Techniques such as Sanger Sequencing and diagnostic digests can be used to facilitate this (Ref).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Can then specifically mention these approaches. Specifically using sequencing primers that anneal to the T0 & T1 for validating inserts and BsaI diagnostic digests for validating insert/backbone*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the build json object is encoded/decoded?\n",
    "\n",
    "BasicBuild objects can be encoded as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import basicsynbio as bsb\n",
    "my_build = bsb.BasicBuild(*my_assemblies)\n",
    "json.dumps(my_build, cls=bsb.BuildEncoder)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent loss of information (discussed later), it is recommended to retain BasicBuild.unique_parts object data, as a separate genbank file (below) or via pickling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bsb.export_sequences_to_file(my_build.unique_parts, file_handle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two options for decoding build.json objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first method uses only the build.json object and results in correct sequences, although, with a loss of metainformation e.g. annotations, features etc.\n",
    "2. The second method uses the build.json object in addition to a collection of BasicPart objects equivalent to that stored in the BasicBuild.unqiue_parts attribute at the time of serialisation. This completely recapitulates the BasicBuild object at the time of serialisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the 1st method is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import basicsynbio as bsb\n",
    "partially_decoded_build = json.loads(build_json, object_hook=bsb.build_object_hook)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the 2nd method is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import basicsynbio as bsb\n",
    "build_unique_parts = bsb.import_parts(build_unqiue_parts_handle, \"genbank\")\n",
    "decoded_build = bsb.decode_build(build_json, *build_unique_parts)\n",
