    "# Violacein pathway assembly using basicsynbio\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to design BASIC assemblies encoding the violacein pathway (*vioABCDE*) with varying Anderson promoter regulating key pathway genes (vioBCD). The following points should guide the design of plasmids:\n",
    "- To minimize the potential for recombination, parts including each promoter should not be repeated within the pathway design.\n",
    "- The designs should mimic those previously generated by Stephanopoulos and colleagues (Xu et al., 2016). Briefly *vioAB* on one plasmid expressed as an operon, *vioCDE* on another plasmid where *vioCE* is expressed as an operon and *vioD* as its own transcriptional unit.\n",
    "- Low-copy number oris should be used (pSC101 and p15A) to minimize burden from strong promoters. Kan and Cam resistance cassettes can be assinged to each plasmid.\n",
    "- While RBS strengths vary with coding sequences, a rough approximation of strength for each available RBS can be inferred from relative GFP expression levels previously quantified (https://www.biolegio.com/products-services/basic/). Notably the following RBSs have a mean relative expression level of 52 % with a standard deviation of 4.3 %, implying similar behaviours: RBS 2, RBS N-3 and RBS N-10. These will be randomly assigned to genes previously reported to influence violacein production (*vioBCD*). The remaining two genes will be assigned RBS N-1 and RBS N-8 which were reported as having similar expression levels.\n",
    "- The BASIC part encoding *vioD* should also contain a downstream terminator sequence, orthogonal to T0 and T1 terminators. L3S2P21 has 41 & 51 % similarity to T0 & T1, respectively. This is similar to the 42 % similarity between T0 and T1, suggesting orthogonality.\n",
